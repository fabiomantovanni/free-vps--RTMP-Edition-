# 1: How this works / What's that?
Hello! My name is Humberto, i really like computer science and open source things. On this repository you can get a "Virtual Machine" but on internet.

This works with the Github actions. We create a machine and this will work for 5 hours. After that time end, we run another automaticly!

# 2: How i can use

So simple, you only need to go in actions tab (https://github.com/humfla123/free-vps--RTMP-Edition-/actions), and run your machine.
But before, you need to fork this repository and change the api key and another things in code, so, THIS ISN'T A THING FOR PEOPLE WHICH DON'T KNOW HOW TO CREATE CODES.
We recommend you to read the code and finally use!
